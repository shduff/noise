# 5 August 2017 — Summer Project Scoping

**Concept Album Plans:**

* Found sound album, mouth sounds, two notes, after dinner mints — Still open...

**Algorithmic Music Plans:**

* Ringtone generator based on your name with varying sound, duration, and frequency

**Jam Session Bible: **

Each page should be the articulation of some structure you can use to facilitate jamming and improvisation with ideas for how to augment and "conduct" the jam. Each entry should include:

* Title

* Subtitle/description

* Necessary materials, space

* Optimal group size

* Description of how to get started, how it works

* Description of the stages of development, levels, etc.

Some of the jams I want to write up in the first version of this book include:

1. The Round Robin + Conducting

    1. Poetry	

    2. Body Sounds

    3. With instruments: choosing key, mood, etc.

2. Establishing groove and passing around the "lead" voice

3. Call and Repeat / Call and Response

4. One Note / Two Note Improvisations based on Tension and Release

5. Blah — Instrumental version of "keep talking for a minute about…"

6. Chord-based layering, passing around the leadership of the rhythm
