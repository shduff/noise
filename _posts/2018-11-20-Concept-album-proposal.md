# Some thoughts about concept art

Concept art used to seem to me like one of the most inaccessible forms of art. It's certainly one of the most abstract. However, viewed from my current perspective, with an interest in the role of novices in living traditions, concept art now strikes me as one of the most accessible forms. 

In the realm of acclaimed-museum- and high-end-gallery-bound work the tradition concept art lives in, the history it points to, and the vocabulary it uses certainly excludes most people. However, the *concept *of concept art (if you will) does not require a connection to this singular tradition. Concept art does not need to be tethered to technique, though it sometimes is. It does not need to be beautiful, though it sometimes is. It does not need to be, and almost by definition can't be, standalone in its nature. It is in response to something else, in conversation with the world. And It is built on *ideas, *something we care a lot about at Powderhouse and something novices can start having before they develop technique or training in a domain.

# Some thoughts about this concept album

For my day-long project, I am going to create a concept album, a short EP of tracks which hang together through their manifestation of an idea. I want to make an album of songs rather than a song because I want to grow in my relationship to composition and idea-having more than my ability to record, edit, and produce with sounds. I want to make a concept album because I think—or at least strongly suspect—that even people who aren't deeply drawn to music can get into making concept albums, and in the longer term I want to begin developing a collection of prompts, ideas, and approaches for composing and recording original pieces that are accessible to people across skill and interest levels with music.

In this specific album, I will first need to choose a concept. Then, I will try to be conscious of that concept in every decision I make in creating the album. What is the idea behind the album overall? How is that concept related to and manifest in each individual tracks? How is each track recorded? Perhaps considering this technically, but also in how many takes? With what instruments? How are things titled? Ordered? What about transitions? To reflect on the album, I will write up an "explanation" of the album—just for myself in remembering and learning from my process—taking note of good and bad decisions, and, worst of all, thoughtless decisions.

For me, this conscious decision-making is what makes concept art exciting to make and consume. If you accept my angle, the only bad decision in this concept album would be one made unintentionally, without cause, without connection to the concept. And I find that freeing and empowering. As someone who feels about recording music the way many do about recording written words, it is comforting to me to know that, in a certain way, my decisions are already successes, once I'm convinced they are conceptually correct. 

# Some reflections about this concept album

## With regards to project quality

* Really focused on intentionality

* Fertilizing the musical soil — reviewing brainstorms from my POS diary and braindump:

    * Found a huge list of concept albums I'd collected and described as well as concept album ideas I’d brainstormed

    * Also a program idea I'd had a while back about making musical maps, the idea of creating non-geographical maps of times in our lives, times in history, etc. 

    * The visualizations for this seemed like too much for a day (e.g. coding something large always takes 10x as long as I can predict) but liked the idea of thinking of the concept album as a map unto itself — of KP and I's relationship

    * Remember when we were in love?

* Fertilizing the process soil — thought about lots of different things I had wanted to try:

    * Free improvisation

    * Drone music

    * Banjo melodies

    * Setting poetry to melodies

    * Found sound recordings

    * Found sound elements in more "normal" recordings

    * Recording in one take

* From all of this I dove in:

    * Track 1 — o my stars — the first time KP and I ever hung out, not romantic

    * Track 2a/b — pull down / spy pond — the moment between our charged email exchanges and meeting when our feelings were expressed

    * Track 3 — anna ayler — meeting his kids, Frozen on the Beach

    * Track 4 — tigey forever — continuing to meet his kids

    * Track 5 —
