# Programs 'n projects, srsly

Musical improvisation —

* Collect School of HONK members' tips and tricks in a beautiful way

* Utilize these tricks, plus others, to improvise a million different things and record

* Collect professional examples of solos that use these tricks to augment

* How could I present these in a beautiful way? A useful way? What form?

Loops —

* Hypothesis: No matter how random, your random thing (when looped) becomes regular

* Loop station: Mess around, what functions, what's the best tool (price vs. ease of use)

* Round robin: Develop a hundred variations, ways to conduct, instrumentations to use

Aural mapping —

* Interactive, digital soundscapes: Sounds added by interaction with onscreen elements, sounds form a multisensory map of a place, sounds that are hidden or evocative, snail pops out and a sound represents that sound

* What about a sample map? Song connections based on where they're sampled from?

Foley effects, soundtracking —

* Can we create different meanings for the same video clip with different soundtracks?

* How different can they be? Can they really suggest different endings altogether?

* What kind of clips are good for these?

Musical field guides —

* Obvious one is of instruments, very interesting objects, uses, users, etc.

* More interesting: How could we make a field guide to a song? Including references? Samples? Etc?

Arranging music —

* I believe this is a deep activity, I at least *love *doing it. I would love to do this with young people, and think the idea of covering songs is very appealing in an intrinsic kind of way. Should I do more work to understand the ways in which I think this work is deep?

More listening —

* I need to be listening to new music with an ear towards all these things!
