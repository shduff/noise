# POS-related program planning

One of the things we decided to commit to collectively this summer—and which I extended a bit for myself—is running a program related to our POS that includes the sprout team. The extension I made for myself is that, in addition to running one program, I want to document 3 to the extent we had the Healey programs documented before getting them underway, e.g. with an arc, daily plans, examples, and etc. all ready to go. Today, I'd like to choose the three programs I am going to prepare and hope that, as I prepare them, and through having M&A respond to/revise them, I will be able to choose the one I want to run with them (Of course, authenticity will also impact this choice, since they don’t really want to make music, per se =P). So… an open brainstorm, pulling on some of those I began thinking about below:

* Jam session bible (a la Rosalie's game bible, but focused on ways to facilitate jams)

* Flutes & waves (documenting and reimagining one I've already run!)

* Conceptual album recording studio

* Loops (would want a collaborator re: including other fields)

* Instrument design & building (would need to be open-ended to be interesting)

* Algorithmic music design & analysis (via Echonest)

* Working with found sound (as yet to be defined)

* Music analysis circle/salon

* Musical memoir writing (using songs to tell the story of your life in moments/phases)

To start narrowing down this list, let's be critical. Here are some glib comments about the feasibility of each with most appealing, remaining options bolded:

* **Jam session bible** — not actually a program, but definitely interesting to me

* **Flutes & waves** — appealing because it builds on past work, but diatonic flutes suck

* **Concept album recording studio** — could be built around personal experience

* Loops — seems interesting but so abstract I maybe don't really know what’s interesting

* Instrument design & building — too broad a focus for me to do well now

* **Algorithmic music design & analysis** — appealing bc I sit at computer all day =) =(

* Working with found sound — no experience with this, but it's cool

* Music analysis circle/salon — could be super douche-y, and also… with whom?

* **Musical memoir writing **— appealing aesthetically, only touches on why ppl like music

From these, I think choosing a focus that allows me to centralize the mediums I work in and the driving questions I'm digging into will make this endeavor the most fruitful. These all focus on deconstructing sound/noise/music and composition. So, I’m going to outline these programs:

* Jam session bible

* Concept album recording studio

* Algorithmic music design & analysis
