# 3P B4 Summer

This obtuse title refers to how I imagine achieving my 3P (e.g. Program, project, proposal from my last entry) by summertime. I have yet to get started on these projects, even after a couple months. Not gonna harp on that inside myself, though you can tell fair reader that I am already doing that if you are actually reading this text. Anyway, here is my plan for how to accomplish these things over the next few months.
