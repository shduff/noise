Musical memoirs

At an individual level, we all have songs that remind us of that breakup, that trip to Vermont, that dark moment before junior year. At a cultural level, there are also songs of the times. Songs which have come to represent a time and place, a cause, a people, a particular moment. In this program, we will tell our own stories, as well as the stories of our families or other communities, through song. We will capture all different kinds of media and reflections about our lives, creating a digital experience that immerses people in the songs of our lives as it walks them through our tales of tumult and triumph.
